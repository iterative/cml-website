# CML Documentation

[Continuous Machine Learning (CML)](/) is an open-source tool for implementing
continuous integration & delivery (CI/CD) in machine learning projects. Use it
to automate parts of your development workflow, including model training and
evaluation, comparing ML experiments across your project history, and monitoring
changing datasets.

## CML principles

- **[GitFlow] for data science.** Use GitLab or GitHub to manage ML experiments,
  track who trained ML models, or modified data and when. Codify data and models
  with [DVC](/doc/cml-with-dvc) instead of pushing to a Git repo.

- **Auto reports for ML experiments.** Auto-generate reports with metrics and
  plots in each Git Pull Request. Rigorous engineering practices help your team
  make informed, data-driven decisions.

- **No additional services.** Build your own ML platform using just GitHub or
  GitLab and your [favorite cloud providers]: AWS, Azure, GCP, or Kubernetes. No
  databases, services or complex setup needed
